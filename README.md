# Diamond_line_reader_pipeline
This pipeline is particularly designed to search hydrogenase genes from rumen metagenome and metatranscriptome data. 
The pipeline will create reference database using fasta file, then analyse the raw sequencing data and give summary txt files as final output.
Pathways, parameters and numbers can be changed to suit other studies.
